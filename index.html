        <p>
          As the Sales Operations Analyst at Calian Group, I am spearheading a
          company-wide CRM optimization project that significantly boosted sales
          pipeline activity and managed sales commissions across various
          business units, directly contributing to the long-term organic growth
          goals. I utilize tools like HubSpot, Excel, and SAP to support ad-hoc
          projects, such as gross margin analysis and revenue forecasting.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an Operations Analyst at Forma.ai, I managed monthly sales data
          worth over $40M. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to
          implement new platform features, developed models and performed
          analyses to drive business decisions, and identified and led process
          improvement projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and Immunology from
          Western University, where I honed my scientific and analytical skills.
          My career spans business strategy and operations, incentive
          compensation, research, and political campaign management,
          strengthening my skills in data analysis, Excel, SQL, critical
          thinking, and problem-solving. I have overseen millions of dollars in
          incentive compensation, synthesized complex news into actionable
          insights, and led a team to a data-backed election victory.
